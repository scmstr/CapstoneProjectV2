Sadly, I cannot include image effects when uploading packages to the asset store (due to version incompatibilities). To get the same look as in the screenshots, download Unity's PostProcessingStack from the Asset Store (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912) and use the Profile included in this package (next to the demoscene). Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your purchase.
